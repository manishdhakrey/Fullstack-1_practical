    <h3>About Course</h3>
    <p>This skillset involves the actual presentation of your website—how the information in your
         website is laid out in browsers and on mobile devices as well. A dedicated front-end developer 
         will be very experienced working with HTML and CSS as well as the scripting language, JavaScript. 
         With these languages, the developer can very efficiently manipulate the information on a website
          to make it appealing and effective.Everything that you actually see on a website—the layout, the 
          positioning of text and images, colors, fonts, buttons, and so on—are all factors that the front-end 
          developer must consider.
          The main goal of a front-end developer is to provide the platform for visitors to interact with,
           a platform which provides and receives information. This means some developers will be
            well-versed in web design and using software such as Photoshop and Illustrator to create
             graphics and themed layouts.</p>
