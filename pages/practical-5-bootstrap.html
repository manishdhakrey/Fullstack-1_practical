    <p style="background-color: grey; color: white;">Bootstrap is a HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses
         on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary
          purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font
           and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge
            find those choices to their liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style
             definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables 
             and form elements across web browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS
              classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents.
               For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings,
                more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.</p>
