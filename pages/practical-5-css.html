    <p style="background-color: grey; color: white;">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet 
        language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language 
        such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
         JavaScript.
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
         including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve 
         content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the 
         specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share
          formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces 
          complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file 
          to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and
           its formatting.</p>
