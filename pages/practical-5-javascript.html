    <p style="background-color: grey; color: white;">JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight,
         interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the 
         scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.
          It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports 
          object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
       JavaScript runs on the client side of the web, which can be used to design / program 
       how the web pages behave on the occurrence of an event. JavaScript is an easy to learn 
       and also powerful scripting language, widely used for controlling web page behavior.</p>
